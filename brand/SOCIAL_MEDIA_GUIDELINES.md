# Lazy Protocol — Social Media Voice Guidelines

## Platform Strategy

### Our Social Philosophy

Lazy's social presence should feel like the protocol itself: **minimal effort to engage with, maximum value delivered.**

We don't chase engagement through controversy or hype. We build trust through consistency, honesty, and quiet confidence. Our social accounts should make followers feel smarter, not anxious.

### Platform Priorities

| Platform | Priority | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Twitter/X** | Primary | Announcements, community, thought leadership |
| **Discord** | Primary | Support, community, governance |
| **Farcaster** | Secondary | Crypto-native audience, experimentation |
| **Telegram** | Secondary | Announcements only (no active community) |
| **LinkedIn** | Tertiary | Institutional credibility, hiring |

---

## Twitter/X Voice

### Personality on Twitter

Think: **A smart friend who works in DeFi but doesn't make it their whole personality.**

- Confident without being cocky
- Helpful without being preachy
- Witty without trying too hard
- Technical when needed, human always

### Tweet Types & Templates

#### 1. Announcements

**Format:** Clear, direct, no hype words

```
lazyUSD is live.

Deposit USDC. Earn yield. That's it.

→ getlazy.xyz
```

```
New vault: lazyETH

Same simplicity. Now for ETH.

Deposit → earn → withdraw whenever.

Details: [link]
```

**Don't:**
```
🚀 HUGE ANNOUNCEMENT 🚀

We're SO EXCITED to finally reveal...
```

---

#### 2. Educational Content

**Format:** Simple explanations of how things work

```
How lazyUSD works:

1. You deposit USDC
2. We deploy to verified strategies
3. Your lazyUSD grows in value
4. Withdraw anytime

No claiming. No staking. No thinking.
```

```
Why withdrawals take 1-3 days:

Your USDC is earning yield in external protocols. When you withdraw, we need to pull it back.

The wait = your money was actually working, not sitting idle.
```

**Don't:**
```
🧵 THREAD: The complete guide to yield optimization strategies in DeFi (1/47)
```

---

#### 3. Performance Updates

**Format:** Data-forward, no hype

```
lazyUSD this month:

APY: 5.2%
TVL: $4.2M
Withdrawals processed: 847
Average wait time: 1.4 days

Boring numbers. That's the point.
```

```
January stats:

$127K in yield distributed
Zero security incidents
1,247 new depositors

Quiet month. Good month.
```

---

#### 4. Thought Leadership

**Format:** Opinions on DeFi, yield, and building

```
Hot take: Most yield protocols are designed for the protocol, not the user.

Claiming rewards, rotating strategies, watching gas—that's work you do for free.

We built Lazy because yield should be passive. Actually passive.
```

```
The best UX is no UX.

If users have to think about your protocol, you've already failed.

Deposit. Earn. Withdraw. Three actions. That's the ceiling.
```

---

#### 5. Community Engagement

**Format:** Genuine, helpful, occasionally funny

**Replying to users:**
```
User: "How long until my withdrawal?"
Lazy: "Checking... you're #4 in queue, should process within ~18 hours. You can track it here: [link]"
```

```
User: "Why should I use Lazy over [competitor]?"
Lazy: "Honest answer: if their UX works for you, use them. We built Lazy for people who want zero maintenance. Try both, keep what works."
```

**Replying to criticism:**
```
User: "1-3 day withdrawals is too slow"
Lazy: "Fair criticism. The delay exists because your USDC is actually deployed earning yield, not sitting idle. Trade-off: higher yield vs. instant access. Not for everyone."
```

---

#### 6. Humor (Use Sparingly)

**Format:** Dry, self-aware, never try-hard

```
New DeFi protocol just dropped with 47 different staking mechanisms, 3 tokens, and a 200-page whitepaper.

Meanwhile: deposit USDC, earn yield.

We're built different (simpler).
```

```
Our roadmap:
- More vaults
- More yield
- Less for you to do

That's it. That's the roadmap.
```

```
Someone asked if we're hiring a "Head of Vibes"

We are not hiring a Head of Vibes.
```

**Don't:**
```
gm frens!! 🌅 who's ready to get LAZY today?? 😴💤

wagmi 🚀🚀🚀
```

### Twitter Don'ts

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Use "gm/gn" unironically | Signals we're trying too hard to fit in |
| Promise specific APYs | Yields change; never guarantee numbers |
| Dunk on competitors by name | Looks insecure; let the product speak |
| Use rocket/moon emojis | Memecoin energy we're avoiding |
| Respond to every FUD | Pick battles; silence is often best |
| Announce partnerships before they're real | Erodes trust |
| Use "SOON" or "announcement coming" | Either announce or don't |
| Thread everything | Most ideas don't need 12 tweets |

### Twitter Do's

| Do | Why |
|----|-----|
| Respond to genuine questions quickly | Builds trust and community |
| Admit when something goes wrong | Honesty > spin |
| Share the "why" behind decisions | Transparency builds loyalty |
| Amplify community members | They're the real marketing |
| Keep most tweets under 200 characters | Respect attention spans |
| Use visuals for data | Charts > walls of text |
| Have a human sign off on tone | Avoid robotic corporate voice |

---

## Discord Voice

### Server Personality

Discord is where the community lives. The tone is slightly warmer than Twitter—more conversational, more helpful, more patient.

Think: **A helpful librarian who actually knows DeFi.**

### Channel-Specific Tones

#### #announcements
- Formal but not stiff
- Clear, structured updates
- Links to relevant docs/tweets

```
📢 lazyETH is now live

You can now deposit ETH and earn yield automatically.

Details: [link]
Docs: [link]

Questions? Ask in #support.
```

#### #support
- Patient and thorough
- Never condescending
- Acknowledge frustration before solving

```
User: "My withdrawal has been pending for 3 days. This is ridiculous."

Lazy Team: "I hear you—waiting is frustrating. Let me check on this.

[checks]

Your withdrawal is #2 in queue and should process within the next 6 hours. The delay was due to a larger-than-usual withdrawal batch.

I'll ping you when it's complete. Sorry for the wait."
```

#### #general
- Casual, community-driven
- Team participates but doesn't dominate
- Occasional humor welcome

```
User: "What's everyone's lazy activity for the weekend?"

Lazy Team: "Watching our TVL grow while doing absolutely nothing. As intended."
```

#### #governance
- More formal, structured
- Focus on facts and process
- Encourage participation

```
New proposal: Adjust withdrawal cooldown from 2 days to 1 day

Pros: Faster access to funds
Cons: Slightly higher operational overhead

Discussion period: 7 days
Vote: [link]

Share your thoughts below.
```

### Discord Don'ts

- Don't ignore questions (even if asked before—link to answers)
- Don't argue with trolls (one response max, then ignore)
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Don't share alpha or speculation about unreleased features
- Don't use @everyone unless absolutely necessary

### Moderation Tone

When moderating, be firm but not aggressive:

```
Good: "This channel is for support questions. For price discussion, please use #general."

Bad: "READ THE RULES. This is your only warning."
```

---

## Farcaster Voice

### Platform Fit

Farcaster skews crypto-native and builder-focused. The audience is more technical and more skeptical of hype. They've seen it all.

**Tone:** Even more direct. Even less marketing-speak.

### Farcaster Examples

```
We don't have a token.
We don't have points.
We don't have a waitlist.

Just vaults that earn yield.

getlazy.xyz
```

```
Building Lazy taught us one thing:

Every feature you add is a feature users have to understand.

So we removed features until only three remained:
- Deposit
- Earn
- Withdraw

Simplicity is a feature.
```

```
Someone asked why we don't have a referral program.

Because if the product is good, people share it.
If it's not, no referral bonus will save it.

We'd rather build a good product.
```

## Content Calendar Framework

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | Content Type |
|-----|--------------|
| Monday | Performance update (if notable) or educational content |
| Tuesday | — (silence is fine) |
| Wednesday | Thought leadership or building update |
| Thursday | Community highlight or RT |
| Friday | Casual/lighter content |
| Weekend | Minimal posting (maybe 1 if organic) |

### Monthly Rhythm

- **Week 1:** Monthly performance recap
- **Week 2:** Educational content focus
- **Week 3:** Building/roadmap updates (if applicable)
- **Week 4:** Community focus, governance updates

### What Triggers Posts

| Event | Response |
|-------|----------|
| New vault launch | Announcement + thread explaining it |
| Security incident | Immediate transparency post |
| TVL milestone | Simple acknowledgment (not celebration) |
| Integration/partnership | Joint announcement when ready |
| Community question trending | Educational response post |
| Competitor drama | Usually silence; occasionally thoughtful take |

## Crisis Communication

### Principles

1. **Speed over polish** — Acknowledge fast, details follow
2. **Honesty over spin** — Never downplay or hide
3. **Responsibility over blame** — Own mistakes fully
4. **Action over words** — Say what you're doing, then do it

### Response Templates

#### Security Incident (Minor)

```
We identified an issue with [X].

What happened: [brief explanation]
Impact: [who/what was affected]
Status: [resolved/investigating]

No funds are at risk. Full post-mortem coming within 24 hours.

Updates in this thread.
```

#### Security Incident (Major)

```
We are investigating a security incident affecting [X].

Deposits and withdrawals are paused while we assess.

If you have funds in Lazy, do not interact with any contracts until we confirm they are safe.

We will share everything we know as soon as we know it.
```

#### Delayed Feature/Withdrawal

```
Withdrawals are taking longer than usual.

Why: [honest reason]
Expected resolution: [time]

Your funds are safe. We're working to process the backlog.

Sorry for the wait—we'll update every [X] hours until resolved.
```

### What NOT to Do in a Crisis

- Don't delete tweets/messages (archive is forever)
- Don't blame external factors without owning your part
- Don't go silent (even "we're investigating" is better)
- Don't promise timelines you can't keep
- Don't use humor to deflect

---

## Metrics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Track But Don't Optimize For)

- Follower count
- Like count
- Impressions

### Meaningful Metrics

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Reply rate | Are people engaging, not just scrolling? |
| Save/bookmark rate | Is content valuable enough to return to? |
| Click-through to product | Does social drive action? |
| Support ticket volume | Is proactive communication reducing confusion? |
| Sentiment in replies | Quality of engagement > quantity |
| Time to response (support) | Are we actually helping? |

### Red Flags to Watch

- Sudden spike in negative replies
- Repeated questions about the same issue
- Declining engagement on announcements
- Community members correcting misinformation

---

## Team Voice vs. Brand Voice

### Official @lazy Account

- Represents the protocol
- Slightly more formal
- No personal opinions on politics/unrelated topics
- Consistent across all team members posting

### Team Member Accounts

Team members can have personal voices, but when discussing Lazy:

- Make clear you work at Lazy
- Don't leak unreleased information
- Don't make promises on behalf of the protocol
- Don't argue with critics (tag official account if needed)

### Founder Voice

Founders can be more personal and opinionated, but:

- Separate personal takes from protocol positions
- Avoid using founder status to "win" arguments
- Be accessible but maintain boundaries

---

## Quick Reference: Voice Checklist

Before posting, ask:

- [ ] Would a smart friend talk like this?
- [ ] Is this honest? (Would we stand by it if screenshotted?)
- [ ] Is this necessary? (Does it add value?)
- [ ] Is this clear? (Would a newcomer understand?)
- [ ] Is this on-brand? (Calm, confident, helpful?)
- [ ] Could this age poorly? (Promises, predictions, takes?)

If any answer is "no," revise or don't post.

## Appendix: Banned Phrases

Never use these in official Lazy communications:

| Phrase | Why |
|--------|-----|
| "To the moon" | Memecoin energy |
| "WAGMI" | Overused, often ironic now |
| "Few understand" | Condescending |
| "Not financial advice" | If you need this disclaimer, reconsider the post |
| "HUGE announcement" | If it's huge, it speaks for itself |
| "LFG" | Try-hard energy |
| "Wen token?" | We don't have one; don't joke about it |
| "Stay tuned" | Either announce or don't |
| "We're so excited" | Show, don't tell |
| "Game-changer" | Let others say this |
| "Revolutionary" | See above |
| "Trust us" | If you have to say it... |
